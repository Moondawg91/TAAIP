# TAAIP White Paper — Talent Acquisition Analytics & Intelligence Platform (TAAIP)

## Purpose
The purpose of this white paper is to propose the Talent Acquisition Analytics and Intelligence Platform (TAAIP), a centralized analytics, targeting, and marketing intelligence capability for 420T Talent Acquisition Technicians. TAAIP aims to improve lead generation, campaign effectiveness, and decision-making through integrated data, predictive analytics, and AI-enhanced targeting.

## Background
Current 420T recruiting operations rely on multiple disconnected systems (iKrome, BI Zone, G2 Zone) which are transitioning to AIM and Vantage. Data is siloed, reporting is delayed, and predictive targeting capabilities are limited. There is also a growing need to apply both Army Targeting methodology and best practices from successful civilian marketing to improve recruitment outcomes.

## Problem / Gaps
- Fragmented data sources hinder timely decision-making.
- Limited predictive targeting and analytics.
- Recruiters lack integrated dashboards and KPIs.
- Current systems do not incorporate LMS-based continuous learning.
- Marketing ROI and campaign effectiveness metrics are incomplete.

## Proposed Solution
TAAIP proposes a unified platform combining frontend (single codebase for web and mobile), backend services (Node.js + Python), secure cloud data storage (Azure Gov), AI/ML targeting, visualization (Power BI/Vantage), and LMS integration. It will ingest historical and real-time data from Army systems, ad platforms, and other sources, providing a centralized dashboard for 420Ts and leadership to make data-driven decisions.

## Targeting Methodology
- Army Targeting Cycle adapted for recruiting: Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, Assess.
- Civilian best practices: segmentation, lead scoring, lookalike audiences, campaign attribution, A/B testing.
- Outputs: prioritized CBSA lists, recommended campaign targets, recruiter task lists, predicted event yields.

## Benefits / Operational Impact
- Improved conversion rates and reduced cost-per-lead.
- Faster decision cycles for leadership.
- Centralized KPIs and CBSA analytics for strategic planning.
- Embedded LMS training increases 420T competency and adoption.
- Predictive analytics allow forecasting of future recruitment outcomes.

## Capabilities
- Centralized KPIs, funnel analytics, CBSA heatmaps.
- Targeting Module: lead scoring, segmentation, lookalike audiences.
- AI forecasting and LMS-based training loop.
- Integrations: iKrome, BI Zone, G2 Zone, AIM, Vantage, Ad platforms, Microsoft Graph.
