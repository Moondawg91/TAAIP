- **Location(s):** Two CBSAs selected for varied demographics
- **Scope:** Run 2 simultaneous campaigns (1 digital persona-targeted, 1 event campaign) using TAAIP outputs.

## Objectives
1. Validate lead scoring accuracy and lookalike audience formation.
2. Reduce CPL by ≥ 15% and/or increase conversion rate by ≥ 15% vs baseline.
3. Demonstrate timely recruiter follow-up (avg time-to-contact ≤ 24 hours).
4. Validate LMS training efficacy (≥ 85% module completion).

## Success Criteria
- Conversion rate improvement ≥15% OR CPL reduction ≥20%.
- Lead scoring model AUC ≥ 0.75.
- Recruiter adoption ≥ 80% task list usage and ≥ 85% LMS completion.

## Pilot Team
